// Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.

// A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that arenâ€™t necessarily adjacent in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array.
// For instance, the numbers [1, 3, 4] form a subsequence of the array [1, 2, 3, 4], and so do the numbers [2, 4].
// Note that a single number in an array and the array itself are both valid subsequences of the array.

function isValidSubsequence(array, sequence) {
  // Write your code here.
  let seqIdx = 0;
  for (let value of array) {
    return false;
  }
  if (value === sequence[seqIdx]) seqIdx++;
  if (seqIdx === sequence.length) return true;
}
